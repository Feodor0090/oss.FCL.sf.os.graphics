*/

In order to update the Symbian Foundation Graphics Wiki pages in an
open and collaborative way, the artwork used must be available under
the EPL license, and must be created using Open Source tools.

This allows other people to re-use our artwork, and allows it to be
maintained by the community.

The SVG artwork has been created using the Inkscape tool.

Please put a pointer on your wiki page to the source files for your
artwork, so the association between this repository and the wiki is
understood.
